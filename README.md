hello GitHub! im excited to work with this coding platform and improve my skills. i enjoy philosophical converstaions and hiking and processed meat and sometimes cliches... depending on the cliche. my ex-boyfriends mom always used to say that cliches were cliche for a reason...

did i overshare? 
thats the million dollar question afterall...
